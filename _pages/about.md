My name is Ana Paula Vizcaya Hern√°ndez, I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics) at Carnegie Mellon University. I work in experimental neutrino physics, my advisor is [Diana Parno](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dianap/index.html). I am part of two different collaborations: KATRIN (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment) which aims to measure the neutrino mass; and TRIMS (Tritium Recoil Ion Mass Spectrometer) which aims to measure the branching ratio to the bound molecular state of tritium beta decay. 

If you are interested in learning more about me and what I specifically do in these experiments take a look at the rest of my webpage or at my [CV](https://anavizcaya.github.io/files/CV_APVH.pdf).
