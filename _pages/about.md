My name is Ana Paula Vizcaya Hernández, I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University working on experimental neutrino physics. I obtained my PhD from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics) in 2021 under the direction of [Diana Parno](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dianap/index.html). There I worken on two neutrino-related experiments, [KATRIN](https://www.katrin.kit.edu/) (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment) and [TRIMS](https://www.npl.washington.edu/TRIMS/) (Tritium Recoil Ion Mass Spectrometer experiment).

I like to study neutrinos because they are really interesting, and super weird, particles. They have helped shape the universe despite being the smallest massive particle and having very weak interactions. They can oscillate between their three flavor states. Furthermore, they can help solve fundamental physics questions like the matter-antimatter asymmetry. I am part of the [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/) collaboration. Two of its major physics goals are to measure neutrino oscillation parameters and to measure the neutrino flux coming from a supernova within our galaxy.

My name is Ana Paula Vizcaya Hernández, I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics) at Carnegie Mellon University. I work in experimental neutrino physics and my advisor is [Diana Parno](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dianap/index.html). I am part of two different collaborations: [KATRIN](https://www.katrin.kit.edu/) (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment) which aims to measure the neutrino mass; and [TRIMS](https://www.npl.washington.edu/TRIMS/) (Tritium Recoil Ion Mass Spectrometer experiment) which aims to measure the branching ratio to the bound molecular state of tritium beta decay.
