# Neutrinos
Neutrinos are created, via the weak interaction, in one of three leptonic flavor eigenstates ν<sub>e</sub>, ν<sub>μ</sub>, and ν<sub>τ</sub> . In the late 1990s, the Super-Kamiokande and SNO experiments provided definite evidence that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, and in order to do so, they must have mass. This experimental discovery was recognized with the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics. 

## The DUNE experiment
The DUNE experiment is a next generation neutrino observatory that will be able to measure: neutrino mixing angles, neutrino charge parity violation (which can shed some light on the matter-antimatter asymmetry), and neutrino mass ordering amongst other things. It will consist of two main detectors placed along the path of a high-intensity (MW-scale) neutrino beam. The near detector, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) will study particle interactions near the beam source. And the far detector will be installed around 1,300 km from the source at the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory and will consist of four Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) modules. A prototype of the far detector is currently deployed at the CERN neutrino platform. ProtoDUNE consists of two LArTPCs


# Research done during my PhD

While in graduate school I was a collaborator in two experiments: the KATRIN Experiment and the TRIMS experiment. Below I give a quick overview of each experiment and of my research in each.

## The KATRIN Experiment

The KATRIN (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino) experiment aims to measure the effective neutrino mass with an unprecedented design sensitivity of 0.2 eV at the 90% confidence level. The electron antineutrino is produced in tritium beta decay together with the beta-electron and a positive ion. The neutrino mass is derived from the energy spectrum of the beta-electron.  Magnetic fields guide charged particles through the energy-analyzing retarding spectrometers towards the KATRIN detector. In this process, ions act as a background source as they further ionize residual gas and produce secondary electrons that can be detected by the main detector. 

The image below shows the KATRIN experiment together with the main steps that the ions go through, a more detailed explanation follows.

Around 10<sup>12</sup> ions per second are created in the source section. If left unperturbed they would travel all the way to the spectrometer section, following magnetic field lines, where they would create background electrons measured by our main detector. So it is really important to stop the ions from reaching the spectrometer section and to monitor the tiny ion flux that may may get there. There are dipole electrodes in the beam line to remove ions; ring electrodes to block them; and also, there are three different ion monitoring system distributed in the experiment.

I have been involved in the measurement planning, simulations, data taking and the analysis phases for three different measurement campaigns. With the objectives of: measuring and monitoring the ion flux through the experiment with three different methods; test and determine the best settings of the ion-blocking mechanisms implemented in the source and transport section, where ions are blocked with positive potentials created by ring electrodes; and test the ion removing mechanisms, where dipole electrodes drift sideways the ions with the ExB drift. 

## The TRIMS experiment
Atomic tritium is really hard to keep in an atomic state. That is why kinematic neutrino mass experiments to date, like KATRIN, use molecular tritium gas T<sub>2</sub> as a source. When one of the bound tritium molecules beta decays, it may excite electronic, rotational or vibrational modes of the daughter molecule <sup>3</sup>HeT<sup>+</sup>. These modes need to be accounted for in order to properly fit the beta spectrum. Theorists have calculated the probability distribution of the excited states of <sup>3</sup>HeT<sup>+</sup>. Nevertheless, this cannot be directly studied with experiments. In order to give credence to the theory, TRIMS measured the probability of T<sub>2</sub> decaying to <sup>3</sup>HeT<sup>+</sup> and compares it with the theoretically predicted values.

The TRIMS (Tritium Recoil Ion Mass Spectrometer) experiment is a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. It consists of a decay chamber with a silicon detector on each end. Molecular tritium gas beta decays inside the chamber producing a neutrino, an ion, and a beta-electron. A magnetic field guides the charged daughter particles towards the detectors while a 60 kV electric field accelerates them. The measured energy of the ion and electron, together with their time of flight is then used to get the mass of the incident ion, and thus the branching ratio to the bound molecule.

I have worked on simulations of the ion detector. On data analysis  and on mantaining the analysis code.
