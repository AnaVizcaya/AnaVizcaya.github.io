I am currently working in two experiments: the KATRIN Experiment and the TRIMS experiment. Below I give a quick overview of each experiment and of my research in each.

## The KATRIN Experiment

The KATRIN (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino) experiment aims to measure the effective neutrino mass with an unprecedented design sensitivity of 0.2 eV at the 90% confidence level. The electron antineutrino is produced in tritium beta decay together with the beta-electron and a positive ion. The neutrino mass is derived from the energy spectrum of the beta-electron.  Magnetic fields guide charged particles through the energy-analyzing retarding spectrometers towards the KATRIN detector. In this process, ions act as a background source as they further ionize residual gas and produce secondary electrons that can be detected by the main detector. 

The image below shows the KATRIN experiment together with the main steps that the ions go through, a more detailed explanation follows.

Around 10<sup>12</sup> ions per second are created in the source section. If left unperturbed they would travel all the way to the spectrometer section, following magnetic field lines, where they would create background electrons measured by our main detector. So it is really important to stop the ions from reaching the spectrometer section and to monitor the tiny ion flux that may may get there. There are dipole electrodes in the beam line to remove ions; ring electrodes to block them; and also, there are three different ion monitoring system distributed in the experiment.

I have been involved in the measurement planning, simulations, data taking and the analysis phases for three different measurement campaigns. With the objectives of: measuring and monitoring the ion flux through the experiment with three different methods; test and determine the best settings of the ion-blocking mechanisms implemented in the source and transport section, where ions are blocked with positive potentials created by ring electrodes; and test the ion removing mechanisms, where dipole electrodes drift sideways the ions with the ExB drift. 

## The TRIMS experiment

The TRIMS (Tritium Recoil Ion Mass Spectrometer) experiment measures the molecular tritium Î² decay branching ratio to the bound state <sup>3</sup>HeT<sup>+</sup>. The setup consists of a decay volume filled with T<sub>2</sub> gas and one detector at each end.  The ions and electrons are accelerated by an electric field, some of them reach the silicon detectors and interact with them.

I have worked on simulations of the ion detector. On data analysis  and on mantaining the analysis code.
